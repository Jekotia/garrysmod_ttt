// Role Shop Mode (Server or round must be restarted for changes to take effect)
// Mode explanation:
// 0 (Disable) - No additional weapons
// 1 (Union) - All weapons available to EITHER the traitor or the detective
// 2 (Intersect) - Only weapons available to BOTH the traitor and the detective
// 3 (Detective) - All weapons available to the detective
// 4 (Traitor) - All weapons available to the traitor

// Examples:
// Assuming the detective can buy "radar" and the "juggernaut suit" and the traitor can buy "radar" and the "banana bomb"
// Then the modes would produce the following results:
// 0 (Disable) - No additional weapons
// 1 (Union) - "radar", "juggernaut suit", and "banana bomb"
// 2 (Intersect) - "radar"
// 3 (Detective) - "radar" and "juggernaut suit"
// 4 (Traitor) - "radar" and "banana bomb"
